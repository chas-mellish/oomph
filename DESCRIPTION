Description: Many data structures can be indexed by a string name e.g. lists, 
   atomic vectors.  Given a vector of names (e.g. the names of elements of a list), 
   this package provides a very fast technique for deriving the index of the element
   associated with this name. The hash derivation is based upon code by Majewski et al (1996) 
   "A Family of Perfect Hashing Methods" <doi:10.1093/comjnl/39.6.547>.
